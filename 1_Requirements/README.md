   4.Functional Requirements :
   Testing is normally achieved by user interface initiated test flows. Not just the flow of a use case is  tested, but the various business rules are also tested. Testing is done by certifying the requirements.  i.e. whether the application is working based on the requirements. 
   Let us take the Example of the application i.e Hospital Management System.
   This is functionality testing and here you will test functionalities like: 
   • Verify whether the user can successfully login with credentials  set
